  Neko is a toolkit designed to make Android development using Clojure
  easier and more fun. It accomplishes this by making adding Clojure
  support to your Android project easy and providing functional
  wrappers and alternatives to Android’s Java API.

  Neko was originally written by [[https://github.com/sattvik][Daniel Solano Gómez]]. This version is
  a fork by Alexander Yakushev as part of Google Summer of Code
  2012/2013 participation project.

** Installation

   Just add the following line to the dependencies of your
   Clojure/Android project:

   [[https://clojars.org/neko][https://clojars.org/neko/latest-version.svg]]

   If you use [[https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid][lein-droid]] to create and build your project (which you
   should), the Neko dependency will already be there.

** Documentation

   For your first dive into Clojure on Android development, see this
   [[https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid/wiki/Tutorial][Tutorial]].

   For detailed information on available features and utilities,
   please consult the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/wiki][wiki]].

   Marginalia docs are available [[http://alexander-yakushev.github.io/neko/][here]].

** How to build Neko yourself

   If you want to modify/extend Neko source code and then use it in
   your applications, you can build it yourself. Use =lein droid jar=
   in neko's directory to create a JAR file which then can be pushed
   to Clojars under your name or installed into a local Maven repo.

   Make sure that =:target-version= defined in =project.clj= matches
   the Android SDK version you have installed.

   If you have problems building Neko, try running =lein clean= first.
   Also you can use =DEBUG=1 lein droid jar= for additional build
   information.

** Acknowledgments

   I thank Remco van 't Veer for his [[https://github.com/remvee/clj-android][clj-android]] library which was one
   of the pioneer attempts to bring Clojure to Android development.
   Some features in my Neko fork are inspired by ideas from his
   project.

   I also thank all the [[https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/neko/graphs/contributors][contributors]] to Neko.
