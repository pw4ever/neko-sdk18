(defn get-resource
  "Resolves the resource ID of a given type with the given name.  For example,
  to refer to what in Java would be R.string.my_string, you can use:

    `(get-resource :string :my-string)`

  The type should be a keyword corresponding to a resource type such as
  :layout, :attr, or :id.

  The name should be a keyword.  If the keyword has a namespace, it will be
  used as the package from which to retrieve the resources.  Generally, this is
  not required as the default will be the application package.  However, this
  can be used to access the resources from the platform.  For example, the
  equivalent to android.R.layout.simple_list_item_1 is:

    `(get-resource :layout :android/simple-list-item-1)`

  The name portion of the name argument will be converted to a string and any
  hyphens or periods will be transformed to underscores.  Note that hyphens are
  not valid in Android names, but are allowed here to be Clojure friendly.

  If the name argument is an integer, it is assumed to be a valid resource ID
  and will be returned as is without any processing."
