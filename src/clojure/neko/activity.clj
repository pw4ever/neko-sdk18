  :on-create - takes a two-argument function. Generates a handler for
  activity's `onCreate` event which automatically calls the
  superOnCreate method and creates a var with the name denoted by
  `:def` (or activity's lower-cased name by default) to store the
  activity object. Then calls the provided function onto the
